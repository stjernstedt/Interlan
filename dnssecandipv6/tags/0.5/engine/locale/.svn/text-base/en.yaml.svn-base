  args: 1
  format: Additional name server listed at child: %s
  descr: A name server listed at the child, but not at the parent, was found. This is most likely a configuration error, but there are sometimes reasons for setting up a zone this way.
  DELEGATION:TOO_FEW_NS:
   args: 1
   format: Too few name servers (%s).
   descr: Only one name server was found for the zone. You should always have at least two name servers for a zone to be able to handle transient connectivity problems.

 DNSSEC:INCONSISTENT_SECURITY:
  args: 1
  format: Inconsistent security for %s - DS found at parent, but no DNSKEY found at child.
  descr: The parent has a secure delegation to the child (indicated by DS RRset at the parent), but the child has no DNSKEY.  This is probably due to a previously signed zone that became unsigned without requesting the parent to remove the secure delegation.

 NAMESERVER:CHECKING_RECURSION:
  args: 2
  format: Checking recursion for %s at address %s.
 NAMESERVER:RECURSIVE:
  args: 2
  format: Name server %s (%s) is recursive.
  descr: The name server answers recursive queries for 3rd parties (such as DNSCheck). By making a recursive query to a name server that provides recursion, an attacker can cause a name server to look up and cache information contained in zones under their control. Thus the victim name server is made to query the attackers malicious name servers, resulting in the victim caching and serving bogus data. 
 NAMESERVER:NOT_RECURSIVE:
  args: 2
  format: Name server %s (%s) is not recursive.
 NAMESERVER:CHECKING_AUTH:
  args: 2
  format: Checking authority for %s (%s).
 NAMESERVER:NOT_AUTH:
  args: 3
  format: Name server %s (%s) not authoritative for %s.

  args: 3
  format: Name server %s (%s) does not answer queries over UDP.
  descr: The name server failed to answer queries sent over UDP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfigured filtering in a firewall.
 NAMESERVER:TESTING_TCP:
  args: 2
  format: Testing TCP queries to name server %s at address %s.
 NAMESERVER:TCP_OK:
  args: 3
  format: Name server %s (%s) answers queries over TCP.
 NAMESERVER:NO_TCP:
  args: 3
  format: Name server %s (%s) does not answer queries over TCP.
  descr: The name server failed to answer queries sent over TCP.  This is probably due to the name server not correctly set up or due to misconfgured filtering in a firewall. It is a rather common misconception that DNS does not need TCP unless they provide zone transfers - perhaps the name server administrator is not aware that TCP usually is a requirement.
 NAMESERVER:TESTING_AXFR:
  args: 2
  format: Testing zone transfer for name server %s (%s).
 NAMESERVER:AXFR_SKIP:
  args: 3
  format: Name server %s (%s) not checked for zone transfer of %s.

  args: 1
  format: SMTP Response: %s
 SMTP:MAIL_FROM_REJECTED:
  args: 1
  format: Host did not accept %s as SMTP destination.
  descr: The mail server did not accept our sender address.  DNSCheck uses a standard null sender address which must be accepted by mail servers.
 SMTP:RCPT_TO:
  args: 1
  format: Using %s as SMTP recipient (RCPT_TO).
 SMTP:RECIPIENT_REJECTED:
  args: 1
  format: Host did not accept %s as SMTP recipient.

 SOA:BEGIN:
  args: 1
  format: Begin testing SOA parameters for %s.
 SOA:NOT_FOUND:
  args: 1
  format: No SOA record found for %s.
  descr: No SOA record was found when querying the name server.  This is most probably due to a misconfiguration at the name server - a zone must have a SOA record.
 SOA:FOUND:
  args: 1
  format: Found SOA record for %s.
 SOA:MULTIPLE_SOA:
  args: 1
  format: Multiple SOA records found for %s.
  descr: Multiple SOA records found when querying the name servers. This is a serious error and definitely due to a misconfiguration.

  args: 2
  format: SOA MNAME for %s valid (%s).
 SOA:NS_NOT_FOUND:
  args: 1
  format: No NS record(s) found for %s.
  descr: No name server records was fould for the zone. This is a serious error and definitely due to a misconfiguration.
 SOA:MNAME_STEALTH:
  args: 2
  format: SOA MNAME for %s (%s) not listed as NS.
  descr: The name server listed as the SOA MNAME is not listed as a name server.
 SOA:MNAME_PUBLIC:
  args: 2
  format: SOA MNAME for %s (%s) listed as NS.
  descr: The name server listed as the SOA MNAME is listed as a name server.
 SOA:MNAME_NOT_AUTH:
  args: 2
  format: SOA MNAME for %s (%s) is not authoritative.
  descr: The name server listed as the original or primary source of data for this zone does not answer authoriative.  This is probably due to a misconfiguration - perhaps the SOA MNAME is not set up as name server for the zone.
 SOA:MNAME_IS_AUTH:
  args: 2
  format: SOA MNAME for %s (%s) is authoritative.
 SOA:RNAME_UNDELIVERABLE:
  args: 3
  format: Failed to deliver email for SOA MNAME of %s (%s) using %s. 
  descr: DNSCheck failed to deliver email to the email address listed as the one responsible for the zone.
 SOA:RNAME_DELIVERABLE:
  args: 3
  format: Successful attempt to deliver email for SOA MNAME of %s (%s) using %s. 
 SOA:RNAME_SYNTAX:
  args: 2
  format: Invalid SOA RNAME syntax for %s: %s
  descr: The email address specified in SOA RNAME is specified incorrectly.  A common error is to use @ in the address field - an address like hostmaster@example.com must be specified as hostmaster.example.com.
 SOA:TTL_SMALL:
  args: 3
  format: SOA TTL for %s too small (%s) - recommended >= %s.
  descr: The smaller the SOA TTL value, the more often resolver need to requery for SOA record.
 SOA:TTL_OK:
  args: 3
  format: SOA TTL for %s OK (%s) - recommended >= %s.
 SOA:REFRESH_SMALL:
  args: 3
  format: SOA refresh for %s too small (%s) - recommended >= %s.
  descr: SOA refresh decides how often a secondary name server should check the primary name server for zone updates.
 SOA:REFRESH_OK:
  args: 3
  format: SOA refresh for %s OK (%s) - recommended >= %s.
 SOA:RETRY_VS_REFRESH:
  args: 3
  format: SOA refresh for %s lower than retry (%s vs %s).
  descr: The retry value is the amount of time your secondary name servers will wait to contact the primary name server again if the last attempt failed.  If the refresh value is lower than the retry value, it's useless.
 SOA:RETRY_SMALL:
  args: 3
  format: SOA retry for %s too small (%s) - recommended >= %s.
  descr: The retry value is the amount of time your secondary name servers will wait to contact the primary name server again if the last attempt failed. If the retry value is too small, the secondary name server will retry too frequently.
 SOA:RETRY_OK:
  args: 3
  format: SOA retry for %s OK (%s) - recommended >= %s.
 SOA:EXPIRE_SMALL:
  args: 3
  format: SOA expire for %s too small (%s) - recommended >= %s.
  descr: The SOA expire value defines how long a secondary name server will wait before considering DNS data for a zone to be too old to serve in case it failed to reach the primary name server.
 SOA:EXPIRE_OK:
  args: 3
  format: SOA expire for %s OK (%s) - recommended >= %s.
 SOA:EXPIRE_VS_REFRESH:
  args: 1
  format: SOA expire for %s lower than refresh.
  descr: The SOA expire value should be at least 7 times the SOA refresh value, to give secondary name servers a fair chance of refreshing their copy of the zone before the data is considered too old to serve.
 SOA:MINIMUM_SMALL:
  args: 3
  format: SOA minimum for %s too small (%s) - recommended >= %s.
  descr: The SOA minimum is used to tell caching resolvers how long they may cache negative answers. If the value is too small, negative caching will not work and resolvers will re-query frequently.
 SOA:MINIMUM_OK:
  args: 3
  format: SOA minimum for %s OK (%s) - recommended >= %s.
 SOA:END:
  args: 1
  format: Done testing SOA parameters for %s.
